        "# DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM \n",
        "Dijkstra Algorithm Python is an algorithm in python that is used to find out the shortest distance or path between any 2 vertices. This is something different from the minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between any 2 vertices can be in such a way that it doesn't include all the vertices of the vertices. This Dijkstra algorithm is even used in navigation systems by google maps, uber/ola rides, etc.\n",

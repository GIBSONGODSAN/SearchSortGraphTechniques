        "# DEPTH FIRST SEARCH\n",
        "The Depth-First Search is a recursive algorithm that uses the concept of backtracking. It involves thorough searches of all the nodes by going ahead if potential, else by backtracking. Here, the word backtrack means once you are moving forward and there are not any more nodes along the present path, you progress backward on an equivalent path to seek out nodes to traverse. All the nodes are progressing to be visited on the current path until all the unvisited nodes are traversed after which subsequent paths are going to be selected.\n",

        "  `The pseudocode for Depth-First Search in python goes as below: In the init() function, notice that we run the DFS function on every node because many times, a graph may contain two different disconnected part and therefore to make sure that we have visited every vertex, we can also run the DFS algorithm at every node.\n",

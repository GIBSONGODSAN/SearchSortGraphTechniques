        "Prim’s algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm which helps to find out the edges of the graph to form the tree including every node with the minimum sum of weights to form the minimum spanning tree. Prim’s algorithm starts with the single source node and later explore all the adjacent nodes of the source node with all the connecting edges. While we are exploring the graphs, we will choose the edges with the minimum weight and those which cannot cause the cycles in the graph.\n",
